The data is stored as mx,Kamioka-event,SK-event with unit in cm^-2
Not yet corrected according to detector form factor and DM-e cross section

-- Setup --
DM-v cross section: 1e-45
Kamioka t_exp: 10s to 9yrs (tot 9 years)
SK t_exp: 9yrs to 35yrs (tot 26 years)

10s -> Kamioka -> 9yrs -> SK -> 26yrs (up to 2022)

Below 6.4 keV, t_max < 9yrs, SK is unable to observed BDM w/ such light mass from LMC
